# Python Scripts

### Tools/Skills 

Python - Cybersecurity, Scripting, Python - Data Science, SQL, matplotlib, pandas, numpy

---

I started learning python several years ago through codecademy. I did all of my initial learning through the context of data science. This means I also experimented with SQL as well as python libraries such as matplotlib, pandas and numpy.

This year, I've started learning python in the context of cybersecurity and scripting.&#x20;

A couple of projects I've done within this domain are below:

#### 1. [Bash Script: Securely Backup User Selected Directory or File](BASH_BackupDirectoryorFile.md)

#### 2. [Finding Source Ports of Attack](Attack_Ports.md)

#### 3. [4 Digit Pin - Brute Force Zip File](4digitpin.md)

#### 4. [Updating ](updating-file-allowed-ip-addresses.md)[F](updating-file-allowed-ip-addresses.md)[ile - Allowed IP Addresses Script](updating-file-allowed-ip-addresses.md)

#### 5. [SSH Login Brute Forcing Script](ssh-login-brute-forcing.md)

#### 6. [SHA 256 Password Cracking](sha256-cracking.md)

#### 7. [Encrypted Files Brute Forcing](https://github.com/jj230/jj230/blob/main/AIG-JobSimulation.md)

#### 8. Decode 9000+ Barcodes
  - This is part of an active BTLO Challenge, so I am unable to post my script. I successfully completed it.
